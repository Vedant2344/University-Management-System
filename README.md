# ðŸŽ“ **Integrated College Management System**

> A `Java`-based system showcasing core `OOP` principles to streamline college administration tasks like managing `admins`, `students`, and `SBG` members â€” with persistent data storage.

---

## ðŸ“š **Overview**

This project demonstrates `Object-Oriented Programming` concepts in `Java`:

âœ… `Inheritance`  
âœ… `Encapsulation`  
âœ… `Abstraction`  
âœ… `Polymorphism`  

It models real-world college operations such as:

- Secure `admin`/`trustee` logins  
- `Student` enrollment and management  
- `SBG` (Student Body Government) member handling  
- Persistent data storage via `CSV`/`TXT` files
