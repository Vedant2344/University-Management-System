# **Integrated College Management System**

> A `Java`-based system showcasing core `OOP` principles to streamline college administration tasks like managing `admins`, `students`, and `SBG` members — with persistent data storage.

##  **Overview**

This project demonstrates `Object-Oriented Programming` concepts in `Java`:

✅ `Inheritance`  
✅ `Encapsulation`  
✅ `Abstraction`  
✅ `Polymorphism`  

It models real-world college operations such as:

- Secure `admin`/`trustee` logins  
- `Student` enrollment and management  
- `SBG` (Student Body Government) member handling  
- Persistent data storage via `CSV`/`TXT` files
